This repository contains my **Java SE best practices exercises** from my university course at **University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY)**.

These exercises are based on the lecture examples and problems from **Chapter 4 to Chapter 14** of our **Java SE Course**, taught by an instructor who truly inspired my programming journey. She was my first programming instructor, and I'm deeply grateful to have learned from someone so bright and excellent in teaching.
